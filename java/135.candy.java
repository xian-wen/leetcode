 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,2]'
 *
 * There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating
 * value given in the integer array ratings.
 * 
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following
 * requirements:
 * 
 * 
 * Each child must have at least one candy.
 * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the
 * candies to the children.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2,
 * 1, 2 candies respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1,
 * 2, 1 candies respectively.
 * The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two
 * conditions.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == ratings.length
 * 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
 *
