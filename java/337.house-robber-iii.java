 * Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3,null,3,null,1]'
 *
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is
 * only one entrance to this area, called root.
 * 
 * Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a
 * tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary
 * tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses
 * were broken into on the same night.
 * 
 * Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the
 * thief can rob without alerting the police.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
 *
